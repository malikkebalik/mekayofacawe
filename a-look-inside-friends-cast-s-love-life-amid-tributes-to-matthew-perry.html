It has been nearly a month since the fan-favorite<strong> Matthew Perry,</strong> who famously portrayed Chandler Bing on the 90s sitcom <i>Friends,</i> passed away at the age of 54. The untimely death of Perry not only sent the expansive <i>Friends </i>fandom into deep mourning but also left the surviving cast members lost for words. &nbsp;</p><p>All eyes have since been on <i>Friends</i>'s remaining five members, which include <strong>Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, Courtney Cox, Matt LeBlanc,</strong> and <strong>David Schwimmer,</strong> all of whom maintained their silence for weeks following their dear friend's demise. Aniston, who played Rachel Green on the sitcom, recently broke her silence on Perry's tragic passing, which led to consequent tributes posted from the rest of the members. &nbsp;</p><h2>A Look Inside 'Friends' Cast's Dating History! &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Perry's unfortunate death was a stark reminder of how fame and money can't buy you everything in life. The late <i>Friends </i>actor struggled with addiction throughout his life and was also unlucky in love. All six of the cast members had busy dating life early in their fame but as years progressed, and the time came to settle down, most of them just couldn't. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/11/19/306534270_125287890271515_7870778324681364927_n%20(1)%20(1)-1700426020856.jpg><p><a href=#>Matthew</a> had a colorful love life during his heyday. The comedian-turned-actor dated the likes of <strong>Yasmeen Bleeth, Julia Roberts, Gwyneth Paltrow,</strong> and <strong>Neve Campbell</strong>. While most of Perry's romances were either short-lived o mere flings, he experienced long relationships with volleyball player <strong>Rachel Dunn </strong>and actress <strong>Lizzy Caplan.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Perry's last flame before his death was <strong>Molly Hurwitz</strong>, with whom he got engaged in late 2020 until their split in 2021. Friends' David Schwimmer, 57, has had a personal life as challenging as his late co-star. David famously dated singer <strong>Natalie Imbruglia</strong> in the 90s and began his relationship with artist<strong> Zoë Buckman </strong>in the early-aughts. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/11/19/292195297_1213198476112818_4504859511648482145_n%20(1)%20(1)-1700426027521.jpg><p>Schwimmer and Buckman were married for seven years, from 2010 to 2017, during which they welcomed one daughter. David, who played Ross Geller on the sitcom, has since maintained an amicable relationship with his ex-wife and also completely sealed his personal life. &nbsp;</p><p>LeBlanc, 56, portrayed the dim-witted, and lady-magnate, Joey Tribbiani, on <i>Friends,</i> but his real love life couldn't be further away from the sitcom. LeBlanc shares a daughter with his ex-wife, <strong>Melissa McKnight,</strong> with whom he was married for three years, from 2003 to 2006. The Emmy-nominated actor last publicly dated his <i>Joey</i> co-star, <strong>Andrea Anders</strong>, from 2006 to 2015.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/11/19/280215084_170258998757869_6921735681465956595_n%20(1)%20(1)-1700426034668.jpg><p>As for the <i>Friends'</i> girls cast, they haven't had the best experience either, except for Lisa Kudrow, who played Phoebe Buffay on the show. Kudrow, 60, has been married to French businessman <strong>Michel Stern </strong>since 1995. The long-married couple share a son, <strong>Julian. &nbsp;</strong></p><p>Courtney Cox, who rose to fame as Monica Geller, is a mother to one. She shares her only daughter, <strong>Coco, </strong>with her ex-husband, <strong>David Arquette</strong>. The ex-spouses were married from 1999 to 2010. Cox's low-key romantic history also includes actor <strong>Michael Keaton,</strong> whom she dated from 1989 to 1995. &nbsp;</p><p>Cox has since been navigating a trying relationship with <strong>Johnny McDaid.</strong> The twosome started dating in 2013 and even announced their engagement in 2014- only to call it off in 2019. The pair, however, continues to share a romantic relationship. Cox's only daughter is the godchild of Aniston. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/11/19/402505527_874426271022451_3676386315588776740_n%20(1)%20(1)-1700426050636.jpg><p>Jennifer Aniston is undoubtedly the best-known of the Friends' six cast and also the only one to live a highly-publicized personal life. Aniston has been married and divorced twice. She was famously married to <strong>Brad Pitt</strong>, from 2000 to 2005. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Aniston's divorce from Pitt was a messy affair and the second time she walked down the aisle, Jennifer seemingly made sure that it didn't garner much buzz. She married <strong>Justin Theroux </strong>in 2015 after nearly four years of dating bliss. The pair parted ways in 2017. &nbsp;</p><h3>'Friends' Cast Tributes to their Late Co-Star! &nbsp;</h3><p>Perry was found unresponsive in his Los Angeles home on October 28. The saddening news had the <i>Friends</i> fandom wrapped in emotional turmoil for days. Even though an official statement was released by Warner Bros, which produced the show, the world was waiting for Friends' cast's reaction to Perry's death. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/11/19/217270254_383469033109885_3382475834125646774_n%20(1)%20(1)-1700426063527.jpg><p>"We are devastated by the passing of our dear friend Matthew Perry," Warner Bros wrote in its statement, <a href=#>adding,</a> "Matthew was an incredibly gifted actor and an indelible part of Warner Bros." The five surviving cast members of Friends have finally let out their feelings after nearly a month of silence. &nbsp;</p><p>Each one of them reminisced about the special chemistry they shared with Perry, and how the late star ignited any room he entered with laughter while battling his evils in secret. Aniston penned a long, emotional tribute to her late co-star. &nbsp;</p><p>"We were always the 6 of us. This was a chosen family that forever changed the course of who we were and what our path was going to be," an excerpt of her tribute read. Cox posted the famous clip of Monica and Chandler's London fling and recalled Perry's significance in her life. "I am so grateful for every moment I had with you Matty and I miss you every day," Cox wrote. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>"We were always the 6 of us," writes Aniston in her tribute to Matthew! </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class=media></figure><p>Kudrow posted a throwback picture of her and Matthew and detailed her early connection with him. "Thank you for your open heart in a six-way relationship that required compromise. And a lot of talking", Kudrow's gratitude-filled tribute read. LeBlanc, in his tribute, bid his goodbye to Perry with a heavy heart. &nbsp;</p><p>"I will always smile when I think of you and I'll never forget you. Never," wrote the actor alongside a funny snap of Joey and Chandler. Schwimmer, for his part, added a Chandler spin on his tribute. Alongside a hilarious throwback pic of Ross and Chandler, David penned a lengthy caption. "I imagine you up there, somewhere, in the same white suit, Could there BE any more clouds?" <a href=#>David wrote</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to<a href=#> Married Celeb </a>for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jppkpaefoHqqutKim55llqe2prrDrGScmaOpeq271Z5kpaGWmnqiucidZK2qmZfCtbHSZquoZZ2WwbW0xLBkqZ2ip8Y%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fa-look-inside-friends-cast-s-love-life-amid-tributes-to-matthew-perry.html&text=A%20Look%20Inside%20%27Friends%27%20Cast%27s%20Love%20Life%20Amid%20Tributes%20to%20Matthew%20Perry&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fa-look-inside-friends-cast-s-love-life-amid-tributes-to-matthew-perry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fa-look-inside-friends-cast-s-love-life-amid-tributes-to-matthew-perry.html&title=A%20Look%20Inside%20%27Friends%27%20Cast%27s%20Love%20Life%20Amid%20Tributes%20to%20Matthew%20Perry" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fa-look-inside-friends-cast-s-love-life-amid-tributes-to-matthew-perry.html&title=A%20Look%20Inside%20%27Friends%27%20Cast%27s%20Love%20Life%20Amid%20Tributes%20to%20Matthew%20Perry" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fa-look-inside-friends-cast-s-love-life-amid-tributes-to-matthew-perry.html&title=A%20Look%20Inside%20%27Friends%27%20Cast%27s%20Love%20Life%20Amid%20Tributes%20to%20Matthew%20Perry" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fa-look-inside-friends-cast-s-love-life-amid-tributes-to-matthew-perry.html&description=A%20Look%20Inside%20%27Friends%27%20Cast%27s%20Love%20Life%20Amid%20Tributes%20to%20Matthew%20Perry" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./after-two-unsuccessful-marriages-elaine-callei-trebek-is-in-a-marital-relationship-with-peter-kares.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="After Two Unsuccessful Marriages, Elaine Callei Trebek Is In A Marital Relationship With Peter Kares">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-aje%C3%A9-wilson-s-boyfriend-know-everything-about-him.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Aje Wilson's boyfriend?
