On August 30, 1955, he was born to his father, Hugh Marston Hefner, and mother, Mildred (“Millie”) Williams. He is, in reality, the magazine publisher’s and his first wife Millie’s first son.</p><p>Hefner grew up in one of the wealthiest families and led a lavish lifestyle. Nonetheless, despite his father’s celebrity, David has kept himself mostly out of the spotlight.</p><h2><span id=David_Hefner_Has_Three_Brothers_and_Sisters>David Hefner Has Three Brothers and Sisters</span></h2><p>He is not the family’s only child. Christie Hefner, Cooper Hefner, and Marston Hefner are his three other siblings. Cooper and Marston are his stepbrothers, while Christie is his biological sister.</p><p>His step-brothers are the result of his father’s second marriage to Kimberley Conrad. All of his siblings are well-established and successful in their own fields. Cooper, his younger brother, is the chief creative officer of Playboy Enterprise. He is also the founder and CEO of the new media firm Hop.</p><p>Similarly, Marston is affiliated with Playboy magazine and is an actor. He has appeared in a number of TV shows and documentaries, including Hef’s Runaway Bride, America’s Book of Secrets, and others. Unfortunately, he was arrested and imprisoned for a year in 2012 for domestic abuse against his girlfriend Claire Sinclair.</p><h2><span id=Christie_his_biological_sister_is_a_businesswoman_and_activist>Christie, his biological sister, is a businesswoman and activist.</span></h2><p>Christie Hefner, David Hefner’s biological sister, is a wealthy businesswoman. She has been with Playboy magazine for almost 30 years and is very active in the family company. She was also the CEO of Playboy for approximately 20 years.</p><p>She allegedly started working for the magazine in 1975 and was named president of Playboy Enterprises in 1982, and then CEO in 1988.</p><p>She is also a philanthropist, having donated $30 million to CORE Chicago. With all of her charity and commercial initiatives, she has been named one of Forbes’ 100 Most Powerful Women several times.</p><h2><span id=What_is_David_Hefner8217s_occupation_His_College_Education_and_Career>What is David Hefner’s occupation? His College Education and Career</span></h2><p>David, unlike his sister and step-brothers, is not involved in the family business. Rather, the star child has forged his own way and established his own company. He enrolled in the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1999 and graduated in 2003 with a bachelor of arts in film and digital media.</p><p>Hugh Hefner’s son David began working as a freelance assistant editor/editor in Los Angeles, California in October 2005, following his graduation. He eventually worked as an editor for Associated Television’s discussion shows. David has also worked on a number of feature picture projects, including Beyond, Robosapien Rebooted, and Shut Up and Shoot.</p><p>Hefner began working as a writer and director for Smoking Cat Films in Los Angeles in 2007. David created and directed his first feature film, ‘Forgotten Pills,’ while working at Smoking Cat. It also took home the main jury prize for best feature at the Dances with Films festival in 2010.</p><p>Hefner also worked as a writer, director, and editor on the feature film “Washed.”</p><p>From 2011 through 2016, the popular star kid worked as an editor at AOL Studious on digital and VR projects. He also worked with some affiliate sites at the time, including The List, Translogic, Hardwired, and Makers.</p><h2><span id=David_Hefner_Hugh_Hefner8217s_son_is_now_a_Video_Editor_at_STAGE3_AGENCY>David Hefner, Hugh Hefner’s son, is now a Video Editor at STAGE3 AGENCY.</span></h2><p>David, who has vast experience in video editing, is currently a video editor at STAGE3 AGENCY in Los Angeles, a digital content agency that produces exciting brand-to-customer interactions. Since June 2021, he has been with the company.</p><p>Hefner formerly worked as an editor at Oath from October 2016 to October 2017. He then resumed his independent career, working as a freelance editor for Netflix’s internal productions. He worked with Hay Day, a successful mobile video game, and Hearst Television.</p><p>According to a 1983 Washington Post article, Hefner was previously a photographer.</p><p>In terms of residency, Hefner now resides in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><h2><span id=What_Is_David_Hefner8217s_Wife8217s_Name>What Is David Hefner’s Wife’s Name?</span></h2><p>David has kept a low profile when it comes to his personal life. There is little information about his wife, or even whether he actually married.</p><p>Although rumors indicate that he has a wife, there are no credible sources to back this up. His silence from social media sites has further added to the mystery surrounding his life. Hopefully, he will tell about his love life in the coming days.</p><h2><span id=Hugh_Hefner_his_father_is_married_to_Thrice>Hugh Hefner, his father, is married to Thrice.</span></h2><p>Hugh, David’s father, has been married three times. He initially married Millie Williams, a Northwestern University student. As previously reported, the couple married in 1949 and had two children from their relationship. However, after ten years of marriage, the husband and wife divorced in 1959.</p><p>He married actress and model Kimberley Conrad for the second time. In 1989, they exchanged vows. Despite their 36-year age difference, he enjoyed his longest relationship with her. Before divorcing in 2010, the couple had two boys.</p><p>Hugh began dating model and TV personality Crystal Harris a year before divorcing his second wife. They married on December 31, 2012, till his death.</p><h2><span id=David_Hefner8217s_parents_divorced_for_what_reason>David Hefner’s parents divorced for what reason?</span></h2><p>Hugh and Midred, David’s parents, had been together since they were in elementary school. Mildred Hefner had an affair with a military guy after their marriage, which she admitted to her then-husband, Hugh.</p><p>They managed to stay together for a while on mutual agreement before divorcing.</p><h2><span id=David8217s_father_passed_away_in_2017>David’s father passed away in 2017.</span></h2><p>Hugh, the creator of Playboy magazine, died on September 27, 2017 in Los Angeles, California. He died at his house in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, California, of sepsis caused by an E. coli infection. He was 91 years old at the time of his death.</p><p>He was buried in Los Angeles’ Westwood Memorial Park, next to Marilyn Monroe, for whom he had paid $75000 in 1992. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times in 2009, he claimed,</p><p>Spending eternity with Marilyn is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><h2><span id=David_Hefner_Net_Worth_His_Father8217s_Estate_After_Death>David Hefner Net Worth, His Father’s Estate After Death</span></h2><p>David Hefner, Hugh Hefner’s son, is unquestionably a prospective heir to his father’s fortune. However, as previously said, he declined the opportunity and now has a great job. When it comes to his net wealth, though, he has remained fairly mute.</p><p>His father, on the other hand, was worth roughly $50 million at the time of his death. According to sources, Daren Metropoulos paid $100 million for the Playboy Mansion.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/"}{"1":78}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong</a></span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>celebrity child</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Kelly Paniagua: Julian McMahon’s Wife, Her Work For A Living</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Untold Truth About Lalania Hudson, Daughter Of Bill Hudson</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfma63tcNmn56enpq%2FbsDHnmSopJSawLV50qilZqeWYrW2s8dmn56enpq%2FcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdavid-hefner-the-oldest-son-of-hugh-hefner.html&text=David%20Hefner%3a%20The%20Oldest%20Son%20Of%20Hugh%20Hefner&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdavid-hefner-the-oldest-son-of-hugh-hefner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-hefner-the-oldest-son-of-hugh-hefner.html&title=David%20Hefner%3a%20The%20Oldest%20Son%20Of%20Hugh%20Hefner" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdavid-hefner-the-oldest-son-of-hugh-hefner.html&title=David%20Hefner%3a%20The%20Oldest%20Son%20Of%20Hugh%20Hefner" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-hefner-the-oldest-son-of-hugh-hefner.html&title=David%20Hefner%3a%20The%20Oldest%20Son%20Of%20Hugh%20Hefner" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdavid-hefner-the-oldest-son-of-hugh-hefner.html&description=David%20Hefner%3a%20The%20Oldest%20Son%20Of%20Hugh%20Hefner" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ed-hill.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="ED Hill">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nnpp-da-jam-iyyun-adawa-7-sun-hada-kai-a-shirin-kifar-da-apc-daga-mulki-a-2027.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="NNPP da Jamiyyun Adawa 7 Sun Hada Kai a Shirin Kifar da APC Daga Mulki a 2027">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
