Delonte is a professional basketball player, best known to have played for various National Basketball Association (NBA) teams such as the Boston Celtics, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Dallas Mavericks. He also played college basketball at Saint Joseph’s University, and all of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Delonte West? As of mid-2016, sources estimate a net worth that is at $100,000, mostly accumulated through a career in basketball. Throughout his career he was offered contracts that helped raise his wealth, however, his net worth is lower than most players and it may be due to the fact that he has had a rather controversial career. Time will tell if his wealth will increase.</p><h3>Delonte West Net Worth $100,000</h3><p>Delonte started to become known for his basketball skills while attending Eleanor Roosevelt High School. He helped the school’s team reach the Maryland 4A championship, however, despite a good performance, the Raiders lost but West was still given honors and awards. After high school, he went to Saint Joseph’s University, where he played with <a href=#>Jameer Nelson</a>. West and helped the team to a 27-0 record in the season and earn them an Elite Eight NCAA Tournament appearance.</p><p>After his junior year at Saint Joseph’s, West left to join the 2004 NBA Draft, and was selected as the 24th overall pick by the Boston Celtics. His rookie year was filled with struggles as he fought injuries, and was switched to the point guard position. The following year he became a starter and performed better. In 2006, he was again put to the shooting guard spot, but had difficulty and was switched back to point guard. During this year, he would get great performances including a career high 31 points and a buzzer-beating winning basket against the Charlotte Bobcats.</p><p>After the 2006 to 2007 season, with <a href=#>Rajon Rondo</a> getting the starting position on the team, he was traded to the Seattle Supersonics, and the following year, he was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers. He played well with the Cavaliers, highlighted by a 20 point performance against the Boston Celtics and a season high 11 assists against the Philadelphia 76ers. He was also a big help during the Cavaliers’ play-off run when they played the Washington Wizards.</p><p>In 2008, he signed a three-year $12.7 million extension which boosted his net worth significantly. He was also switched back to the shooting guard position to make room for Mo Williams. He would showcase his skills throughout the next season, helping the team get a franchise best 66 wins. He also helped the team during the play-offs, becoming a role player for a line-up that included <a href=#>LeBron James</a>. In the 2009 to 2010 season, West’s averages started to decline, and he was soon traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves, but was soon waived. In 2010, he signed a one year contract with the Boston Celtics as <a href=#>Rondo’s</a> backup point guard. However, he was suspended for the first 10 games of the season due to criminal charges. The following year he signed with the Dallas Mavericks, but was again suspended in 2012 due to internal arguments, and was subsequently waived by the team.</p><p>In the following years, Delonte would become part of the NBA D-League, playing with the Texas Legends. After a year, he moved to China to play with Fujian Xunxing and then the Shanghai Sharks. He then played with the Venezuelan team Guaros de Lara before returning to the Texas Legends.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that West was diagnosed with bipolar disorder which may have resulted from the stress of the NBA lifestyle. He was arrested in 2009 because it was discovered that he was carrying multiple firearms while riding a motorcycle. He was also rumoured to have had a relationship with <a href=#>LeBron James’</a> mother, and this apparently effected his reputation.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=12.733031674208><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Delonte West</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$100,000</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>1.223&nbsp;million USD</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 26, 1983</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Washington, D.C., United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft 3 in (1.91 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>181 lbs (82 kg)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Profession</td><td>American Professional Basketball player for NBA</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Eleanor Roosevelt High School, Saint Joseph’s University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Caressa Suzzette Madden (m. 2013)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Cash West</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Dmitri West, Delphina Addison</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Dmitri West Jr., Danielle West</td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/charleeredz13</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm2715960</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>Elite Eight NCAA Tournament</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nominations</td><td>Third-team All-American – NABC, TSN (2004), First-team All-Atlantic(2003, 2004)</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=6><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>1</td><td>Signed as a free agent by the Boston Celtics.
