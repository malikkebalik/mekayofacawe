What has he been up to since he hung up his cleats? First, let’s ask how old Brett Favre is. The 52-year-old has stayed out of the spotlight for the most part.</p><p style=text-align:justify>As seen on <strong>iSpot.tv</strong>, Favre still does commercials and shows up in the media every so often. Favre, on the other hand, hasn’t gone into broadcasting like many quarterbacks of his level have.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Packers News says that Favre is enjoying his life after football by doing things he couldn’t do while playing, like traveling. Favre now lives in <strong>Sumrall, Mississippi</strong>.
