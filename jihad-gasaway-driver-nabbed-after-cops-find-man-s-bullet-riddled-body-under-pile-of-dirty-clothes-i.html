He was alive and talking to me.”</p><p>However, officials noted that Gasaway “did not notify anyone of the male subject inside the vehicle”, “did not call 911 to request medical assistance,” and did not tell troopers about Harriel until they found the body.</p><p>Gasaway claimed that Harriet was alive when the car broke down when asked by officials and stated that the two men had "got into it."</p><p>Investigators later determined the shooting happened on the passenger side of the vehicle. A 9mm shell casing was found in the front floorboard and two bullets were inside the front passenger door.</p><p>According to the arrest report, it was discovered upon examination that the shell casings had been fired by the same gun found on Gasaway.</p><p>When the autopsy found that Harriel died as a result of two gunshot wounds fired at close range, his death was ruled as homicide.</p><p>The charges against Gasaway were changed from abuse of corpse to first-degree murder on October 5.</p><h2 class=split>Tributes have poured in for Kemp Harriel on social media</h2><p>Alexus May, Harriel's friend, posted "I am having such a hard time processing this,”</p><p>“You were always so kind-hearted and genuine always kept it 100 with me. One thing for sure you made sure everyone had a good time around you and you were always the life of the party. You will forever be missed and loved!
