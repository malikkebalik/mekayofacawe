The night was filled with laughter, thoughtful questions, challenging questions – and lots of wine. I loved falling in love with Mike Hagerty but the cherry on top was the friendship that developed between him and Stuart. Fighting cancer, Stuart would tell me, "don't worry, I won't die before I marry you two." Stuart didn't get to marry us…..but his big sister did. And Susan Scott crushed it. Today, on Stuart's birthday, I want to thank Susan for gracing us with her eloquence, thoughtfulness and humor while giving us the gift of marriage. And while there's three of us in these pictures….we all know there were really four. We love you Susan Scott♥️</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>Laura Okmin</a> (@lauraokmin) on Jul 19, 2017 at 5:09pm PDT</p></figure><p>In addition, Okmin and Hagerty are still yet to start a family of their own.
