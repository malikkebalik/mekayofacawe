She is a two-times Golden Globe and one Emmy award winning actress, who has made her name in film and on Broadway alike, appearing in a number of critically acclaimed films and plays. Parker’s performance in the Broadway musical “Proof” found particular success, earning her a Tony Award for Best Actress in 2001.</p><p>So just how rich is actress Mary-Louise, as of mid-2016? Authoritative sources estimate that she has accrued a net worth of more than $12 million over the course of her career to date, which began in 1988.</p><h3>Mary-Louise Parker Net Worth $12 Million</h3><p>Mary-Louise Parker was a regular military brat – her father, John Morgan Parker, was a judge with the US Army at the time of her birth. Parker spent much of her youth travelling around the world as the family moved in accordance with her father’s postings, and she has spent time variously in Germany, France, Thailand and several states of the US. Acting appears to have been Mary-Louise Parker’s passion since at least her high school years, and the future professional actress went on to study drama in the North Carolina School of the Arts graduating in 1986. Parker’s first roles were theatre and opera productions, and the 1990 Broadway play “Prelude to a Kiss” – written and directed by Craig Lucas – is widely considered Mary-Louise’s breakout performance.</p><p>Having toured the US together with the “Prelude to a Kiss” cast, Mary-Louise Parker broke through on the big screen in 1995 with the film version of another of Lucas’s productions, “Reckless”, in which Parker performed alongside fellow lead actress <a href=#>Mia Farrow</a>. Parker’s film debut, while relatively low-profile, paved the way for her role in the successful 1996 “The Portrait of a Lady” – which boasted a true celebrity cast including <a href=#>John Malkovich</a>, <a href=#>Christian Bale</a> and <a href=#>Barbara Hershey</a> among others. Since then, Mary-Louise Parker has continued to appear in various cinema adaptations of plays, including possibly her most successful appearance in HBO’s hit miniseries, “Angels in America”, alongside <a href=#>Al Pacino</a>, <a href=#>Meryl Streep</a> and <a href=#>Patrick Wilson</a>, and for which she won Primetime Emmy and Golden Globe awards for Best Supporting Actress. Another Golden Globe for Parker’s performance in the comedy-drama series “Weeds” as the central character, Nancy Botwin, followed in 2006.</p><p>A versatile and talented actress, Mary-Louise has worked alongside such fellow celebrities as <a href=#>Nicole Kidman</a>, <a href=#>Viggo Mortensen</a>, <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a> and <a href=#>Bruce Willis</a> throughout her career, and her ability to hold her own and stand out even alongside such giants of acting is ample proof of Parker’s ability as an actress, and of the fact that her impressive net worth is well-deserved. She has appeared in over 30 films, and more than 20 TV productions.</p><p>Most recently, Parker has appeared in the 2013 action comedy “RED 2”, which sees Parker in a lead role alongside <a href=#>Bruce Willis</a>, <a href=#>John Malkovich</a> and <a href=#>Catherine Zeta-Jones</a>, and in an off-Broadway play by <a title="Simon Stephens" href=#>Simon Stephens</a>, “Heisenberg”, produced&nbsp; by the Manhattan Theatre Club in 2015.</p><p>In her personal life, Mary-Louise lived with actor <a href=#>Billy Crudup</a>(1997-2003) with whom she has a son, and despite a subsequent engagement to fellow actor and “Weeds” co-star <a href=#>Jeffrey Dean Morgan</a>,&nbsp; Parker remains single. Since 2013, the actress has been involved with the foundation “Hope North”, devoted to helping the victims of the civil war in Uganda, as well as a number of other charitable causes.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=22.622478386167><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Mary-Louise Parker</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$12 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 2, 1964</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Fort Jackson, Columbia, South Carolina, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 8 in (1.73 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Film actress</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>International School Bangkok, University of North Carolina School of the Arts</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>William Atticus Crudup, Caroline Aberash Parker</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>John Parker, Caroline Louise Morelli Parker</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nicknames</td><td>Mary Louise Parker , Moore and Parker</td></tr><tr readability=0.23880597014925><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/Mary-Louise-Parker-493571717366589</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.30434782608696><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.myspace.com/marylouiseparker</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000571</a></td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Awards</td><td>Theatre World Awards (19900, Tony Award for Best Actress (2001), Primetime Emmy (2004), Golden Globe awards for Best Supporting Actress (2004, 2006), Drama Desk Awards for Outstanding Actress in a Play, Satellite Awards for Best Actress in Television Series Musical or Comedy</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Nominations</td><td>Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or a Movie, Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a...</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Movies</td><td>"The Portrait of a Lady" (1996), "Reckless" (1995), "Prelude to a Kiss" (1990)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>TV Shows</td><td>“RED 2” (2013), "Heisenberg" (2015), “Weeds” (2006), “Angels in America” (2003)</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks readability=1.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>Often plays loud, talkative women</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=47.742518351214><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>I never know why people come up to me.
