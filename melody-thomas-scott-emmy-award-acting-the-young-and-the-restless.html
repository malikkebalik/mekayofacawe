The loss of weight makes the story line even more authentic, Most people put thru the kidnapping trauma would probably lose a little weight from the stress.</p><p>It seems like MTS was dealing with illness during filming recently too. I read that in an article while the lake house sl was unfolding. She’s certainly a pro. Her character is imperfect (as we all are) but she’s compelling. I’ve always enjoyed any scene she’s involved in. It makes me feel a little better that the writers realize we need to see the fallout of the alcohol IV addressed at least on a minimal level. I realize it’s a soap world, but she had enough trauma to warrant thorough medical follow-up, blood work, & mental health care. Instead, we have them all returning to the ranch with instructions not to drink (ignored by Victor) and open bars still scattered around. I try to tell myself that’s “in character” for Victor to be self-focused and indulgent but it seems Victoria and/or Nick might think about the realities of alcohol sitting around after what Nikki endured.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>I adore Melody Thomas Scott!

He could keep it at his office or under lock and key if he must have it. But in the end it’s his house and Victoria / Nick can’t control what he does.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>MTS was amazing yesterday. But the weird camera angles and cuts undermined the scene.</p><p>I can only think they filmed it that way because they were trying to hide the fact that they were using one of the Newman offices for the AA meeting so they could only use very tight shots that wouldn’t show the whole room.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>I thought the meeting took place at the Club because the lady with the long hair, I noticed walked in when Nate was talking with Tucker and she went the direction opposite the stairs.
