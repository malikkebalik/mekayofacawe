He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a poor African-American family who lived in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), his mother, played the clarinet and piano, aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She belonged to the Jehovah's Witnesses sect. Joseph Walter "Joe" Jackson, a former boxer, worked as a crane operator at US Steel and supplemented the family's income by playing guitar with the Falcons, a local rhythm and blues band. Joe's great-grandfather, July "Jack" Gale, was a US Army scout who was also a Native American medicine man, according to family legend.</p><p><strong>Professional Career: -&nbsp;</strong>The Jackson 5 left Motown in 1975. They signed with Epic Records, a CBS Records subsidiary, and changed their name to the Jacksons. Around this time, their younger brother Randy joined the band, while Jermaine remained with Motown and pursued a solo career. Between 1976 and 1984, the Jacksons continued to tour internationally and released six more albums. During this period, Michael, the group's main songwriter, wrote songs such as "Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)" (1978), "This Place Hotel" (1980), and "Can You Feel It" (1981).</p><p>Jackson relocated to New York City in 1977 to play the Scarecrow in Sidney Lumet's musical The Wiz. Diana Ross, Nipsey Russell, and Ted Ross also appeared in the film. The film was a flop at the box office. Quincy Jones, who later produced three of Jackson's solo albums, arranged the score. Jackson frequented the Studio 54 nightclub in New York, where he heard early hip hop, which influenced his beatboxing on later tracks such as "Working Day and Night." Jackson broke his nose during a dance routine in 1978. Following a rhinoplasty, he experienced breathing difficulties, which hampered his career. Steven Hoefflin, who performed Jackson's operations, was referred to him.</p><h2><img alt="Michael Jackson Wiki" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/savedaughters.com/public/ckimages/ck_1649329510.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h2><h3><strong><strong>Net Worth of&nbsp;Michael Jackson</strong></strong></h3><p>His Net Worth is $1 billion (Debt - $500 million)</p><h3><strong><strong>Social Account of Michael Jackson</strong></strong></h3><h3>Instagram:&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Click here</strong></a></h3><p>Facebook:&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Click here</strong></a></p><p>Twitter:&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Click here</strong></a></p><p>Wikipedia:&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Click here</strong></a></p><p>YouTube: <strong><a href=#>Click here</a></strong></p><h3><strong><strong>FAQ About Michael Jackson</strong></strong></h3><h3><strong>Q.1 Who is </strong><strong>Michael Jackson</strong><strong>?</strong></h3><p>Ans.
