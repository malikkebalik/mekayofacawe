A lot about her love life can also be deduced from her songs. With a turbulent love life, here’s everything you need to know about the Indie pop queen.</h3><p>Natalie Merchant, who wore her long grey hair today, lived a life of love, support, tears, accomplishments, and triumph. If we’re being honest, multiple failed relationships and divorce can also be included in this category. When she was linked with Michael Stipe, one of her first publicly known boyfriends, the singer’s first well-known affair occurred.</p><h2>Michael Stipe: The Man Natalie Merchant Desired Forever But Didn’t Get</h2><p>It had only been two years since Ms. Merchant joined 10,000 Maniacs, the New York-based folk and alternative band that catapulted her to success and fame. With thousands of album copies sold, the band toured to Athena in Atlanta, Georgia, where fate brought Natalie and R.E.M. vocalist Michael Stipe together in 1983.</p><p>Natalie and Michael were both enthusiastic about their bands and eager to see the other bands perform. However, because both of the young people were shy in their early twenties, their first meeting did not go as well as they had hoped. In fact, when Natalie met Michael for the first time officially after the conclusion of a party event, she ended up waiting for Michael for half an hour with his bag outside a bathroom toilet.</p><p>Did we mention she had feelings for R.E.M’s lead singer and drove nearly 500 miles just to see the band? Michael later admitted that he did what he did because he was too shy to continue the conversation with Natalie. Mikey, the poor guy, actually escaped the party through the bathroom window. And the only reason he returned was because of the bag he had left with Natalie.</p><h2>What Happens Next in Their Story?</h2><p>Of course, on the other side of the story, Merchant was filled with not only embarrassment but also rage. After all, she had every right to be there. Who, no matter how shy or introverted you are, makes someone wait with their belongings outside a toilet room, especially at a party?</p><p>When Stipe returned, Merchant left the venue after aggressively handing back the bag and deciding to despise Michael. But, of course, Merchant runs into Stipe again, this time in her hometown of Buffalo, New York, near where the veteran singer and her band practice. R.E.M. was actually on stage.</p><p>By their next reunion, it appears that all hatred for Michael had vanished. What are you talking about? Natalie was ecstatic to see R.E.M. and even approached them. What about Michael Stipe? Yes, he, too, was overjoyed to see Natalie. And the next thing they knew, the duo, who were ironically wearing pajamas, were laughing and sharing dinner at a nearby vegan restaurant.</p><p>Natalie and Michael fell in love, to cut a long story short. Although what they had couldn’t last forever, it was certainly entertaining while it lasted. Apart from sharing common musical interests, with the exception that Natalie despised Michael’s penchant for partying in LA and her envy for his ability to connect with and learn from musicians of all genres, the pair remained professional and personal supporters of one another.</p><p>A decade later, around the time Natalie left 10,000 Maniacs, Natalie’s former lover came out as a bisexual man who preferred men over women. However, it is expected that the Wonder singer remains friends with Michael, who is currently dating a man named Thomas Dazol.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Natalie-Merchant-300x169.jpg><h2>A Merchant’s Marriage Resulted In A Daughter</h2><p>Natalie Merchant married her ex-husband, Spanish documentary filmmaker Daniel de la Calle, in 2003. In less than a year after their wedding, the Tigerlily singer and Calle welcomed their first child, Lucia de la Calle. Moreover, during her pregnancy, the singer resumed her vegan diet, which she had been following since 1980.</p><p>Merchant decided to take a break from music the same year she became enamored with the role of motherhood. Natalie didn’t release her next album for another seven years. Merchant and Danielle traveled extensively throughout their marriage. Mr. Calle was even seen on stage cheering on his wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Natalie-Merchant-2-300x298.jpg><p>Unfortunately, everything came to an end when Natalie and her husband divorced after nearly seven years as a husband and wife. The singer was the one who made the announcement to the public.</p><p>Today, Natalie Merchant is back to her business, which is making music and touring, which she enjoys the most.</p><p>You may also like: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Shahadi Wright Joseph</a>, <a href=# rel=bookmark>Willow Smith</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaKaRqa6ttcRmpJ6qk52ur8CO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnatalie-merchant.html&text=Natalie%20Merchant&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnatalie-merchant.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnatalie-merchant.html&title=Natalie%20Merchant" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnatalie-merchant.html&title=Natalie%20Merchant" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnatalie-merchant.html&title=Natalie%20Merchant" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnatalie-merchant.html&description=Natalie%20Merchant" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./nba-star-kawhi-leonard-s-sister-charged-with-murdering-elderly-woman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="NBA star Kawhi Leonards sister charged with murdering elderly woman">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./michael-madsen-bio-age-net-worth-height-wiki-facts-and-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Madsen - Bio, Age, net worth, height, Wiki, Facts and Family">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
