As a dad to three older daughters, Bruce was overprotective of their love lives. His family reciprocates their love these days by supporting him through his retirement and health challenges.</p><p class=dh>Over thirty years ago, the award-winning actor Bruce Willis became a dad for the first time after welcoming his first daughter, Rumer Willis, with his ex-wife, Demi Moore.</p><p class=dh>The "J.I Jane" actress later welcomed two girls, Scout and Tallulah Willis. Although their marriage did not last forever, their friendship did; the former celebrity couple jointly parented their kids and has since shared an inseparable bond, including a blended family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/9c25b59cabd2c0025d136fd0903a4dca.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Bruce Willis, Rumer Willis and Demi Moore on March 24, 2011 in New York City | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Following his marriage to model Emma Heming, "The Sixth Sense" star became a dad to two daughters, Mabel Rae and Evelyn Penn. He had his <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/bruce-willis-becomes-a-father-for-the-fifth-time-meaning-59yearold-has-as-many-children-as-die-hard-movies-9335696.html>youngest </a>at 59.</p><p class=dh>Despite having two separate families, Bruce has been intentional in raising his daughters and being a present feature in their lives. His <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZD0yIwcbHM&t=182s">first daughter</a>, Rumer, who inherited his acting skills, confirmed that her dad is the sweetest, as she revealed in the past that he cries while watching her perform on stage.</p><p class=dh>While Bruce may experience tear-jerking moments with his kids, they also make him profoundly happy through their successful careers and life choices.</p><p class=dh>Recently, Rumer shocked fans when she declared that she would be expecting a baby with her boyfriend, Derek Richard Thomas. Although her post was without a caption, the shared <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CmaKz9UpM8e/>photos </a>spoke a thousand words.</p><p class=dh>It included a distant silhouette shot of the expectant mom standing near a French window and an up-close black-and-white photo of Thomas kissing the baby bump.</p><p class=dh>This would be Bruce and <a class="me a" href=#>Moore</a>'s first grandchild. Following the announcement, many fans and family members posted heart-melting comments. Rumer's stepmother, Emma, took to Instagram to share their joy. She uploaded similar photos with an added caption that <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CmaLd3_OiIc/>read</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Baby news is happy news!!! Congratulations. We are elated over here!"</p><p class=dh>Moore, seemingly ageless and recently posed in bikinis, showing off her curves, was equally pleased that her daughter would make her a grandmother. She updated some snaps, and to prove that she was ready for an excellent job at grandparenting, the actress <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/rumer-willis-is-pregnant-actress-daughter-of-bruce-willis-and-demi-moore-expecting-first-baby/>quipped</a>, "entering my hot kooky unhinged grandma era."</p><p class=dh>Indeed, Rumer is blessed with parents who, for many years, have kept a healthy relationship and prioritized their kids, despite being with other people. Post-divorce, Bruce emphasized that he still loved Moore, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/bruce-willis-171842/>adding</a>:</p><p class=dh>"We're very close. We realize we have a lifelong commitment to our kids. Our friendship continues. The institution has been set aside."</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Bruce Willis Was Protective of His Daughters</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>The "Unbreakable" actor remained true to his words, maintained close ties with Moore, and put their kids first, despite his career—this parenting style affected his daughters positively.</p><p class=dh>His oldest child once claimed she was grateful for her parents' effort and commitment. Working as a team while leading separate lives made it easier on her, and she never chose who the better parent was between them.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>According to the family statement shared in March, he had suffered some health challenges and had been diagnosed with aphasia.</strong></h3><p class=dh>As a much older parent, <a class="me a" href=#>Bruce </a>is still actively involved in his kids' lives. Earlier in the year, he scheduled a nice father-daughter outing with his girls. Emma later posted the adorable moment online, mentioning that her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/20220216133252/bruce-willis-date-scout-rumer-post-valentines-day/>husband </a>is a "girl-dad" on the "cutest" date.</p><p class=dh>Many years before the captivating outing with his babies, "The Fifth Element" star hoped for a time when he would intimidate his daughters' suitors. However, he never lived his dream because his daughters took charge of their lives.</p><p class=dh>During their teenage years, he developed tactics to keep their boyfriends on their toes. While describing how his methods often played out, he revealed that he often put the boys in charge and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/bruce_willis_on/>added</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I just say 'Dude, what's your name?' and he says 'Oh, Cinjun.' I say 'Cinjun, you're in charge. If anything happens to one of my daughters, I'm coming to you first, and then I'm going to kill all your friends right in front of you, and you'll be last.'"</p><p class=dh>Fortunately, the girl-dad never killed anyone, as he equipped his daughters with the right family values that guided their paths. Through the years, they learned to take charge of their lives, and according to the actor, his girls updated his archaic way of approaching relationships.</p><p class=dh>Eventually, his daughters crushed his fantasy of intimidating their suitors. "They just say I don't understand what the dating world is like," he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.express.co.uk/celebrity-news/206546/Willis-is-a-pushover-for-daughters>mused</a>.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Retiree Bruce Willis Cushions on His Family's Support</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Bruce's contributions to the entertainment world have earned him love and accolades from many, including fans, friends, family, and fellow celebrities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/777b926abbf7665b3f58df41c73ad481.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Rumer Willis, Demi Moore, Bruce Willis, Scout Willis, Emma Heming Willis and Tallulah Willis on September 23, 2019 in Los Angeles, California | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>In his private life, his commitment to family is reciprocated as they have rallied around him in his time of need. The actor surprised fans after announcing he would be retiring from his job as an actor.</p><p class=dh>According to the family statement shared in March, the actor suffered health challenges and was diagnosed with aphasia. They explained the symptoms, noting that the diagnosis affects the brain, language expression, and comprehension. They <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2022/04/bruce-willis-aphasia-diagnosis-family-support-enjoying-time-left-together>added</a>:</p><p class=dh>"This is a really challenging time for our family and we are so appreciative of your continued love, compassion and support. We are moving through this as a strong family unit…As Bruce always says, 'Live it up' and together we plan to do just that."</p><p class=dh>The Willis family is focused on creating happy moments while they treasure their time with the actor. Following the announcement, Emma celebrated Mabel's 10th birthday, and an <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2022/04/bruce-willis-aphasia-diagnosis-family-support-enjoying-time-left-together>insider </a>said that the family is "doing whatever they can [to support him]" and "they have rallied around him in a big way to help Bruce cope with what is to come."</p><p class=dh>Thankfully, everyone is hands-on, making the actor feel positive while he goes through his health challenges gracefully— and at 67, Bruce is set to become a granddad for the first time.
