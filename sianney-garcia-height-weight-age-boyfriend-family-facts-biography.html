At that exact time, their dad was diagnosed with cancer but eventually survived and made a recovery.</li><li>Sianney was a straight-A student in school.</li><li>She annoyed her sister by constantly asking “Is it okay?” and always waiting for her answer.</li><li>Her older brother, Danny has blue eyes while she and Angelise have dark brown eyes.</li><li>She doesn’t speak Spanish but people still told her she has an accent, even though she was born in the United States.</li><li>Her sister wants to scrape the color from Sianney’s room because it’s fully pink – from walls, blankets, pillows, to even dolls. She also feels like she wants to forcibly change the color of Angelise’s room because it’s is furnished in a mixture of purple, white, and blue.</li><li>She and her sister almost got kidnapped when they were 5 or 6 years old. Her dad was at a boxing match to watch their brother Danny and they were at the house with their mom and another brother Erik. They snuck out and left the house without telling anyone, just in flip flops and capris. While on the street in their neighborhood, a car pulled up next to them and a pretty woman came out. The woman eventually dragged them into her car by their hands and at the 1st stop sign, she and her sister started giving each other signals, escaped the car, and ran home. The woman drove back to their house chasing them and even started knocking on their door. Their mom and brother were sleeping and didn’t hear the commotion, so in fear, they only told their parents about the event when they were already 13 years old.</li><li>Besides almost getting kidnapped, the scariest thing Sianney remembers happened when she was 7 years old. She went down to the basement and appeared to see a burnt woman with no hands near a wooden table, whose head flipped around, and freaked her out.</li><li>Sianney would rather know how she’s gonna die than when she’s gonna die because she could try and stay away from the thing that would eventually cause her death.</li><li>She and her sister are telepathic and even did a telepathic challenge. Both she and Angelise could feel each other’s pain and also could guess the number other one thought of.</li><li>In April 2016, she and her sisters promised that a new single will be released once their Instagram account hits a milestone of 10k followers. The single was titled Ashame&nbsp;and was officially released on December 30, 2016.</li><li>Visit her group’s official website @ siangietwins.com.</li><li>Follow her on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Instagram</a>.</li><li>Follow her group on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Instagram</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Twitter</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>TikTok</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>YouTube</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Apple Music</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Spotify</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>SoundCloud</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Last.fm</a>.</li><p>Featured Image by Sianney Garcia / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqygmqaemsZus8CrmqKZXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsianney-garcia-height-weight-age-boyfriend-family-facts-biography.html&text=Sianney%20Garcia%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%2c%20Biography&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsianney-garcia-height-weight-age-boyfriend-family-facts-biography.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsianney-garcia-height-weight-age-boyfriend-family-facts-biography.html&title=Sianney%20Garcia%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%2c%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsianney-garcia-height-weight-age-boyfriend-family-facts-biography.html&title=Sianney%20Garcia%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%2c%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsianney-garcia-height-weight-age-boyfriend-family-facts-biography.html&title=Sianney%20Garcia%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%2c%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsianney-garcia-height-weight-age-boyfriend-family-facts-biography.html&description=Sianney%20Garcia%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Boyfriend%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%2c%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-jay-norvell-s-wife-kim-norvell-inside-the-csu-rams-hc-s-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Jay Norvells Wife, Kim Norvell?
